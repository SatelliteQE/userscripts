## How to install?

You need user script support extension in your browser, like Tampermonkey (Chrome, Firefox) or Greasemonkey (Firefox only).

- [Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
- [Tampermonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
- [Greasemonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)

Find script that you like in `scripts` directory. Open it and click `Raw` button to see source of file directly.

Confirm when extension prompts you to install script in your browser.
